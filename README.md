Floppy Adapter for the Osborne 1
--------------------------------

1. The Osborne 1 uses a non-standard Shugart floppy interface.  This KiCAD project accounts for those 
differences and supports an interface to a GoTek floppy disk emulator.

2. +5V power for the GoTek is available directly from the floppy cable.

3. Jumper only S1 on GoTek.

4. GoTek part number is:  SFR1M44-U100K

5. GoTek connector is a Sullins PPPC172LJBN-RC

Richard Loxley has done a lot of good work on the Osborne 1.  His site is a *great* resource for
how to get CP/M-formatted floppy disk images working on the GoTek.
